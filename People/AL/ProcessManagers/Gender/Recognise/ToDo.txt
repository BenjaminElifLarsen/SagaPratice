When done with the refracting so the program can start up again:
	1) Work on GenderRecogniseProcessRouter (consider a new name)
	2) Work on the pm and event repo to ensure they are fully done.
	3) Update the service to use the new design
	4) Update PeopleApiServices (and rename to PersonApiServices)
	5) Work on middleware to ensure the Router is ready and services subscribe to the state events via the event bus
	6) Need to ensure that the newly created (or retrived for that matter) pm are subscribed to the correct events

	update PersonReplacedGender and PersonalInformationChanged to system event
	move them to another location than the domain event folder in DL
