When figured out how to best do Saga, make generic version or similar and add to Common project and then push the Common project.

since dealing with events for the saga, maybe look into event sourcing at the same time.

update ValueObject to be a record instead of class, if a record can be abstract

consider based your solution on the Domain Events section from https://vaadin.com/blog/ddd-part-2-tactical-domain-driven-design#_guideline_2_refer_to_other_aggregates_by_id
but code to work with the idea of no service can run all the time
also look at Domain Services
