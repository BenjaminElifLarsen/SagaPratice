Design for starting a vehicle
Need to valdiate that both the vehicle and operator exist
Operator needs to have permission to use the vehicle (need to have the vehicle id on their list)
Vehicle needs to have permission for the operator to use it (operator needs to be on the vehicle's operator list)
Operator needs a valid and non-expired license
	Vehicle knows not of the license type needed. This lies in the vehicle information
	Vehicle knows it vehicle information
	So need to fetch the vehicle information and check if the operator has a license with the same license type id as the vehicle information

	if the operator does not have the correct license type the operation needs to be stopped and the user needs to be informed.
	if the operator does have the correct license type the license's expired needs to be checked
		if it has expired the user needs to know
		if not the vehicle should be started up
			if the vehicle has already started up inform the user about this

	the license should be validated if it has expired or not 

Commands needed:
	AttemptToStartVehicle //consider better name for the first command
	FindOperator
	FindVehicle
	CheckPermissions
	GetVehicleInformationLicenseType //might not be needed
	StartVehicle
	CheckIfVehicleIsAlreadyStarted

Events needed:
	OperatorNotFound
	VehicleNotFound
	VehicleStartedSuccessed
	VehicleStartedFailed
	OperatorLackedPermission
	OperatorHadPermission
	VehicleInformationLicenseTypeArquired
	OperatorLackedNeededLicense
	OperatorLicenseExpired
	OperatorWasFound
	VehicleWasFound

	//how to handle any misalignment in the vehicle's operatorId collection and operator's vehicleId collection?
	//if any is not found should remove their id from the list of the other

	//instead of using the current command handler StartOperatingVehicle consider completely rewrite it to better fit the activity diagram

	//is it really needed to fetch the vehicle infromation license type via a command? Could just check in a handler. After all not modifing that aggregate, just fetching a read model.
